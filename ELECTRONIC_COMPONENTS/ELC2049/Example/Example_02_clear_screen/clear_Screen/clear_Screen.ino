/***********************************************************************************
*This program is a demo of clearing screen to display black,white,red,green,blue.
*This demo was made for LCD modules with 8bit data port.
*This program requires the the LCDKIWI library.

* File                : clear_Screen.ino
* Hardware Environment: Arduino UNO&Mega2560
* Build Environment   : Arduino

*Set the pins to the correct ones for your development shield or breakout board.
*This demo use the BREAKOUT BOARD only and use these 8bit data lines to the LCD,
*pin usage as follow:
*                  LCD_CS  LCD_CD  LCD_WR  LCD_RD  LCD_RST  SD_SS  SD_DI  SD_DO  SD_SCK 
*     Arduino Uno    A3      A2      A1      A0      A4      10     11     12      13                            
*Arduino Mega2560    A3      A2      A1      A0      A4      10     11     12      13                           

*                  LCD_D0  LCD_D1  LCD_D2  LCD_D3  LCD_D4  LCD_D5  LCD_D6  LCD_D7  
*     Arduino Uno    8       9       2       3       4       5       6       7
